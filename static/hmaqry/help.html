    <h2>About</h2>
    <p>
        This web application can be used to query the TxDOT
        SiteManager database for hot-mix asphalt (HMA) related items.
    </p>
    <h2>Query</h2>
    <p>
        Queries are run based on user defined settings. The items to include
        in the query are selected in the left panels. This allows queries to
        be tailored to specific mixtures, locations, etc, based on the items
        selected in each of the panels. These panels include multi-selection
        parent/child type trees to facilitate the selection or de-selection of
        query groups as defined below. Selecting the "Root" node will select all
        of its children. Once all query selections have been made, the Data Query
        panel provides options to extract information from the SiteManager database.
    </p>
    <h3>Mixtures</h3>
    <p>
        Select the HMA mixtures to query by clicking the respective checkboxes.
        HMA mixtures have been sub-divided by diffferent mixture types:
        <ul>
            <li>Dense-graded asphalt (DGA)</li>
            <li>Permeable friction course (PFC)</li>
            <li>Performance-related mixtures (PERF)</li>
            <li>Stone-matrix asphalt (SMA)</li>
            <li>Thin overlay mixtures (TOM)</li>
            <li>Thin bonded wearing course (TBWC)</li>
            <li>Crack attenuating mixtures (CMA)</li>
        </ul>
        This grouping provides an initial breakdown of mixtures listed in
        SiteManager. Within each of these groups, further subdivision by
        type is possible. Thus PERF mixtures, for example, include both
        Superpave (SP) and coarse matrix high binder (CMHB) mixtures, etc.
        Selecting the parent node will select each of its associated children.
        </br></br>All mixtures are selected by default.
    </p>
    <h3>Locations</h3>
    <p>
    A breakdown of districts and counties within these districts is provided
    in the Texas tree to restrict queries to specific locations if required.
    </br></br>All locations are selected by default.
    </p>
    <h3>From/To Date</h3>
    <p>
        Each of these options allows restricting the query to extract data between
        the selected from and to dates. If only a from date is provided, then the query
        will extract all records from that specific date. If a to date is provided, all
        records up until the to date will be extracted. If neither a from nor a to date
        is provided, the query will extract records regardless of date. The date query
        uses the date that a lot was completed to identify these records.
        </br></br>No from and to dates are selected by default.
    </p>
    <h3>Data Query</h3>
    <p>
        Select the type and nature of the data to query:
    </p>
    <h4>Agency</h4>
    <p>
        The query processes and outputs either TxDOT (default) or contractor data.
    </p>
    <h4>Level</h4>
    <p>
        Indicate how the data should be summarized, either by project (default) or by lot.
        If by project, data collected on all lots within the project will be averaged.
        If by lot, data collected on all sublots will be averaged.
    </p>
    <h4>Select query</h4>
    <p>
        Select the specific data to query. The follwing options are provided:
    </p>
    <ul>
        <li>Lab Density: The density of laboratory comapcted specimen.</li>
        <li>Voids in the mix (VIM): The air voids in the mix determined from road cores.</li>
        <li>Voids in the mineral aggregate (VMA): VMA determine from plant mix.</li>
    </ul>
